=================

This library (derived from the Dreamforce 2012 presentation on [Apex Enterprise Patterns](https://github.com/financialforcedev/df12-apex-enterprise-patterns)) progresses the patterns further with a more general home for them. While also leading up to an updated presentation at Dreamforce 2013! It also attempts to add some form of namespace qualification from the previous version. So that classes are grouped together more easily in the IDE's and packages.
